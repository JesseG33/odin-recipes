<p>1st on our list is Nyama Choma, the national dish of Kenya. Kenyan traditions
    are all about socializing with friends and family, and what better way to socialize
    with those you love than an epic back yard bbq. In Kenya, 
    typically goat or lamb will be used in smaller gatherings, and an entire cow 
    for bigger occasions like weddings. 
    For this recipe, use which ever one you prefer.
<h2> Here's what you will need:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Large cuts of goat, beef, or lamb.</li>
<li>A large charcoal grill (or perhaps multiple grills!)</li>
<li>Salt and spices</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preperation:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cut the sections of meat into manageable portions</li>
<li>Heat the grill (or grills) so that the coals burn at a low heat</li>
<li>Invite your friends and family over for a day of fun around the grill!</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you've got everyhting ready to go the only thing that's missing is
   your side dishes. But don't worry! If you haven't prepared anything yet
   we have provided a tasty Kenyan selection 
   for you <a href="../index.html"><strong>Here!</strong></a>
</p>
<p>Now the grill is hot (but not too hot) and you have your 
    good sized portions of meat ready for the <i>moto</i>(fire)
    the next steps are the easiest but also the most important.
</p>
<h2>Cooking:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Place the large portions of meat directly onto the grill 
    (be sure to allow a small gap between peices)</li>
 <li>Cook on low heat, turning every twenty to thirty minutes</li>



</ol>
