<p>1st on our list is Nyama Choma, the national dish of Kenya. Kenyan traditions
    are all about socializing with friends and family, and what better way to socialize
    with those you love than an epic back yard bbq. In Kenya, 
    typically goat or lamb will be used for smaller gatherings, and an entire cow 
    for bigger occasions like weddings. 
    You can use which ever one you prefer for this recipe.
<h2> Here's what you will need</h2>
<ul>
<li>Large cuts of goat, beef, or lamb.</li>
<li></li>

</ul>
